# Robot control with mobile


This is a mobile communication project and a servo motor, which is done by an ESP module.
Recovering the command from the user by the mobile application, these commands are received by the ESP connection protocol, and then transmits a serial communication information for an AVR microcontroller, and then the signal is generated to move the servo motor and Makes servo motor move.

To connect a robot to a robot we need the following hardware components:
- A smartphone with Android operating system
- One Wifi Hardware Module (ESP)
- One microcontroller avr
- One servo motor
- Voltage source

# Mobile Application!
To create an Android app, we've used Google's IDE, Android Studio. The programming language used to write its program is kotlin and java.
